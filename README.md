# JCR Dict
This repository contains the source code for [jcrdict.com](), a website for displaying information about Jamaican Creole words.

I created this website because Jamaican Creole is commonly spoken among Jamaicans but has rarely been written until recently. I learned that the Bible was translated into Jamaican Creole by the West Indies Bible Society in 2012 I saw an opportunity to create a website that makes information about the words used in that publication more accessible.
